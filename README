Steps to execute (this only works on mac/linux)

Download file 

Open a terminal window and change directory to where the file is located

Set permissions to execute the script so run 

chmod 755 networkTest 

To run the script run this command

 ./networkConnectivyTest 

If you need to add a proxy here is the syntax 

 ./networkTest <proxyhost> <proxyport>

Finally there should be a file called 'output.log' created in the same
directory please send that back to your support person or SE so they can 
look at the results.
